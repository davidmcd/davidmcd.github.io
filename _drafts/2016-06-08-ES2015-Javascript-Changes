## ES2015 Javascript Changes

Javascript is ever-changing it seems.  There are a bunch of new features including...
- Arrow Functions (arg) => {return res;}
- Shorthand for methods: render() { ... }
- const and let instead of var

Here are a few links to some articles outlining the latest:
- [ECMAScript 2015 Spec](https://docs.meteor.com/packages/ecmascript.html)
- [Medium Overview of Changes](https://medium.com/ecmascript-2015)

I'm sure that if you look around, you'll find many more!
