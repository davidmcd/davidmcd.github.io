## A New Post

If you are reading this, then everything is working.
I'm trying out [Prose.IO](http://prose.io) which is a service 
that directly reads and writes to my blog on Github.  With Prose, i can type markdown in their browser.  Hopefully it will save and commit this when I'm done.  


*Update* - it didn't show up.  I have some
specific frontmatter tags that I want to use.
I will continue to play with Prose.IO to
see if how I can make it work.  

Regards,  
-Dave.
