## A New Post

If you are reading this, then everything is working.  I'm trying out [Prose.IO](http://www.prose.io) which is a service that directly reads and writes to my blog on Github.  With Prose, i can type markdown in their browser.  Hopefully it will save and commit this when I'm done.  

Regards,
-Dave.
