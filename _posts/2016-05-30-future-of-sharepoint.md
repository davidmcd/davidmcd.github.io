Earlier this month Microsoft announced a bunch of [new and exciting changes](https://blogs.office.com/2016/05/04/the-future-of-sharepoint/)
that will be coming soon to SharePoint.  Bob German, a former Microsoft MTC Architect 
wrote a nice summary - 
[Roadmap to the Future of SharePoint](https://bob1german.com/2016/05/07/roadmap-to-the-future-of-sharepoint/)

The interesting part (to me at least) is Bob's thoughts on preparing for the SharePoint 
programming model.  SharePoint will be built on open source tools like npm, gulp, and yeoman.
The SharePoint framework is written in React too.
It seems like a good time to invest in your javascript development skills too.
