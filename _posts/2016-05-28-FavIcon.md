Part of my (re)Education is learning about building modern websites.
As part of that pursuit, I just ran into a new topic - FavIcon.
FavIcon is the icon file that is used on Windows, iOS, and Android to
save a link to the site.  

To make generating one easier, try [Real Fav Icon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net).
