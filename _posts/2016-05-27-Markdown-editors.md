Ok, so now we know more about *markdown* syntax.  The next 
topic is what tools are there to help me write it.  Here are
some things that seem important (note that I am still in
for dummies mode)

* I'd like a simple editor where I can just type
  * understands markdown and gives me syntax highlighting
  * lets me easily see what the user will see
  * side by side viewing so I can see both at once
* Lets me create new files and manage my files easily
* Works directly with git so I can see/connect my posts
* Spell checker would be valuable to catch pesky type-o's

## Solution

So I'm only a few hours into my first day of using Markdown. 
At this point I'm pretty happy with Visual Studio Code.  I'm 
using it on my MacBook.  It addressess all of the criterial above. 
As I type this, I have an adjacent window open showing a view 
of the output text.  VS-Code also provides a view of my file 
system and I can easily create a new post and start working on 
it.  Since it understands Git, i can commit this without leaving 
the editor.  *Note that I still have to push from my local git 
back to my blog on GitHub*
