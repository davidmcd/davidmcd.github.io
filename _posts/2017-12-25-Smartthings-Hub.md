## SmartThings Home Automation - #4 on Holiday Techie Fun Project List
Santa knows what I like!  He brought me the [Samsung SmartThings Hub](https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/hubs/f-hub-us-2-f-hub-us-2/) and an [outlet](https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/outlets/samsung-smartthings-outlet-f-out-us-2/) for the same.  

It took me a little while to get the app to let me log in/register.  I found the Samsung app for iOS to be pretty confusing.  I'm still not sure that i'm getting it when it comes to working with the app.  I understand that there are REST APIs so it may be worthwhile to look for better solutions.  

The [Arrival Sensor](https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/sensors/f-arr-us-2-f-arr-us-2/) looks pretty cool.  Also this is supposed to work with a whole bunch of differnt sensors supporting Z-Wave and Zigbee.
