### Markdown for Dummies (Me)

Ok, so what is **Markdown**?  
  >Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting 
  syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats 
  using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, 
  for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text 
  using a plain text editor.  
  > -[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Best summary:  Markdown is a **writing** format, HTML is a **publishing** format.

BTW, markdown is just a perl script!  Checkout [Dingus on Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus) 
to try it out directly from a browser.  

Github understands markdown and it will convert markdown to html. Here are a few useful
links for reference:

* [Github Markdown Help](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) has a nice short 
tutorial.
* [Github Guides - Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)  
* [Daring Fireball - Great Info!](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#overview)
