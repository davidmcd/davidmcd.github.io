So it turns out that ADAL is now [morphing into MSAL](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/ad/2016/03/31/microsoft-identity-at-build-2016/).  I saw a 
podcast on Channel 9 with [Vittorio Bertocci](http://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/)
in which he dropped the new news (to me) that there is a new
framework in town, and it is bigger and badder than ADAL ever was.

There is a pretty good [Build Video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B868)
from Vittorio about the future direction of Microsoft Identity.
