## Home Automation with Cortana - #6 on Holiday Techie Fun Project List

Ok, I have this cool Harmon Kardon Cortana device.  You can think of it being like the Amazon Alexa except it is Cortana AND it has a GREAT speaker.  Since it is Cortana it includes great features like making Skype calls, reading your calendar etc.  

To link up with SmartThings, there is a SmartHome feature in the cortana notebook.  Once i connected my SmartThings I could ask Cortana "Turn on the Lights" and my hue lights turned on.  It is super easy how all of this comes together.  

Next i'm shopping for compatible outlets.  I'm considering whether or not to get actual outlets and install them myself.  Hmmm.
